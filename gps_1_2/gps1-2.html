			<p>Pair programming is a development technique where two programmers collaborate
	      		on a single coding problem.  It consists of a driver, who types the code, and
	      		a navigator who sort of guides the driver along in the right direction.The 3 main
	      		combinations of pair programming would be expert-expert, expert-novice, and novice.
	      		</p>
	      		<p>Why is pair programming important to DBC? DBC wants to prepare us for "the real world" and this is
	      		a skill we will need in software development. Further, it teaches empathy for fellow programmers and
	      		enhances emotional intelligence, and it is a great learning tool. Mistakes are minimized with two
	        	sets of eyes on the program. The benfits are:
