		<h4>Exploring My Values</h4>
		<p>The following is a list of important values to me and assessment of how I live up to those values.
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Value</th><th>Degree to Which I Live Up to Value</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Accomplishment</td><td>Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- <span class="highlight">4</span> ----- 5 Agree</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Close Relationships</td><td>Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- <span class="highlight">3</span> ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Creativity</td><td>Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- <span class="highlight">5</span> Agree</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Growth</td><td>Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- <span class="highlight">4</span> ----- 5 Agree</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Self-knowledge</td><td>Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- <span class="highlight">3</span> ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>One value that is particularly important to me is growth. I am starting an interesting and exciting new phase professionally and personally and I am having to grow quickly. I have found that growth is not always pleasant, but I can feel that new parts of me are opening up.
		</p>
		<p>The last thing the someone asked me for advice on had to do with accomplishment. A colleague at the job that I am leaving to pursue web development was considering a similar switch. She was concerned with having to start over in terms of accruing professional accomplishments in a new field. My advice was that it's far worse to stay in field where you are unsatisfied than to start over and learn something new.
		</p>
		<p>When I think about my values, I feel the strongest emotional reaction from creativity and growth. My desire to create new and interesting things helps me deal with any potential stereotype threat from starting over in a new field in my 40s. I think growth and creativity are closely related in that ability. The things I'm learning about myself are both motivating and discouraging. However, I feel that encountering obstacles is an essential motivator for growth.
		</p>
		<p>If I'm feeling down at DBC, I will try to utilize different resources including engaging with cohort mates, meditation, breathing techniques and writing and reflection.
