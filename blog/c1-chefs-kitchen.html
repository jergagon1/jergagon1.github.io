<h1>11/23/14 Cultural Blog: Chefs in the Kitchen</h1>

<h2>Reflections on the Culture of Devbootcamp</h2>

<p>As I set out on my journey with Devbootcamp, I am both extremely excited and extremely nervous. I believe these feelings stem from uncertainty about my skill level and the expectations of what I've signed up for.</p>

<p>Luckily, there are some great resources available to students to help manage expectations including a video introduction to the culture of DBC: Shereef's Fireside Chat. In it, Shereef discusses how Devbootcamp came to be and how it has developed over time. He reflects on the culture and dynamics of how things work at DBC and some of the things that affect a student's success.</p>

<p>The central theme of the chat is that Devbootcamp is a "big experiment". Things are constantly developing and changing. Students tend to succeed if they have a compatible mindset with the experiment.</p>

<p>Students tend to arrive at Devbootcamp with one of two mindsets:</p>

<p>The first is the "restaurant" mindset, where a student feels that they can get their education by paying money, getting a download of the material, completing a set of tasks and then going off to get a job. They want their education served up like something ordered from a restaurant.</p>

<p>The second mindset is the "kitchen" mindset, where you show up and "put an apron on" to help make things happen.  You decide that you are going to make the experience your own. You engage, lead, show initiative, help, teach, learn, experiment, etc...</p>

<p>Shereef talks about how most people have a mixture of these mindsets and that you need to learn to encourage one and discourage the other.</p>

<p>The kitchen mindset is clearly the path to success at DBC as well as everything else in life.</p>

<p>From watching Shereef's video, I have a very positive impression of DBC and I believe that the spirit of the school is in keeping with the culture of software development.</p>

<p>My impression is that to be a software developer, you have to be open, curious, confident, willing to help others, willing to learn from others and able to work with other people in a highly productive and empathetic way. You share your expertise and freely admit your ignorance about something.</p>

<p>I believe that DBC has been designed to help encourage these traits in students and my impression is that personal growth in these areas is far more important than just learning to code.</p>

<p>I believe that this will be a great learning experience for me and I am ready to embrace the culture.
</p>

<p>In the past, I had a passive or reactive mindset about my career path. With that as my mindset, life provided exactly what I was asking for: a career path that I was not really happy with, my potential was unrealized and I was undervalued as an employee.</p>

<p>DBC is the first specific deliberate career choice I have made. I am not afraid of the challenge of growing and making this my own. I am afraid of NOT doing so and ending up in the same random dead-end situation.
</p>

<p>In my research prior to signing up for DBC, I had a sense that it was a place where you made your own destiny based on your level of engagement and commitment. After watching Shereef's video, I am happy to know that I wasn't far off target. It was helpful to hear it explained explicitly.</p>

<p>I am excited to participate in this learning environment because I feel I have a lot of room for growth in my emotional intelligence. I feel that growth in that area will unlock my potential.</p>

<p>I am also nervous about the process for the same reason: I have a lot of room for growth in my emotional intelligence.</p>

<p>I can't wait to see how I develop through the process.</p>
