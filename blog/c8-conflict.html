		<h1>Conflict</h1>
		<h2>Lock 4 People in a Van for 3 Months</h2>
		<h3>January 25, 2015</h3>
		<p>In my former life, I played drums in a touring rock band. A band is a close-knit group of people who live and travel in close quarters and as a result, there can be a lot of chaos and conflict.
		</p>To add further complexity, my band included my sister, her husband and a roving cast of bass players. So, take the normal level of complexity and add family dynamics to it!
		<p>There were numerous times when the stress and frustration was overwhelming. Over the 10 years that I played with the band, I had to develop a number of techniques to deal with conflict (other than just hitting the drums really hard).
		</p>
		<p>When we first starting making records, we had a knock-down drag-out fight during a recording session over the way I was playing something. There was a drum part that I was particularly attached to that got changed by my band mates. I was not happy about it.
		</p>
		<p>I felt that I was the drummer and that I knew what the perfect drum part should be. On a deeper level, I felt that my ability and musical taste were being called into question.
		</p>
		<p>As with any group, there were constant power struggles and I felt that the band was taking away my power.
		</p>
		<p>To diffuse the situation, I decided to take a break and get some fresh air. During my walk, I was able to calm down and reflect that my reaction had nothing to do with the process of making music.  It had to do with my ego!
		</p>
		<p>Whether or not the drum part seemed perfect to me, it was not connecting to the songwriter and thus not conveying the intent or spirit of the song.
		</p>
		<p>This was the beginning of a new awareness for me. It centered around the question: <q>Why are we all sitting in this room?</q> The answer was to create music. It was not for me to be proven right or to show off. It was to collaborate and to create something awesome.
		</p>
		<p>Music, like any creative process, involves vision and determination, but also compromise and empathy.
		</p>
		<p>From that point on, I made a conscious effort to be open to everyoneâ€™s ideas. I made a point of both expressing my ideas and not reacting negatively if the ideas were not received.
		</p>
		<p>The process of recording was much more enjoyable when I adopted that mindset and I was constantly ending up in new exciting places musically.
