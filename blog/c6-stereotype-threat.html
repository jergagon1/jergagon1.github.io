		<h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
		<!--<h2>subtitle</h2>-->
		<h3>January 11, 2015</h3>
		<p>Stereotype threat is a concept where the risk or reality of being judged based on your social identities negatively impacts your performance and/or choices in life. The term was first introduced by psychologist Dr. Claude Steele, who identified the trend when he noticed higher school dropout rates and lower grades in African American students despite high SAT scores or diverse economic backgrounds.
		</p>

		<p>Central to this idea is that we all have social identities. These can include age, sex, race, religion, profession, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, region, social class, ideological persuasion, political affiliation or mental health.
		</p>

		<p>An <q>identity contingency</q> can occur when a negative stereotype associated with one of your social identities becomes relevant to the outcome of a situation. The importance of that social identity affects how strongly you are impacted by that negative stereotype.
		</p>

		<p>The awareness of a negative stereotype tends to create underperformance in academic achievement. Dr. Steele discussed research where a group of high school students - who all excelled in math - were given a GRE level math exam. Each student was tested in a room by themselves. Due to the stereotype that women do not perform well in math, when they encountered advanced material, the female students began to identify their performance problems with the stereotype. Consequently, their scores were lower than the male students.
		</p>

		<p>An identical test was conducted except that this time, the female students were told that women perform as well as men on the test. The test results changed dramatically and the female students were comparable to the male students.
		</p>

		<p>Clearly, this demonstrates that the perception of a threat to one of our central social identities profoundly impacts our performance and achievement in life.
		</p>

		<p>In my own life, I am switching careers in my forties and attending DevBootcamp. I am faced with the stereotype that web development and tech is a game for the young. I feel at times that I don’t have a chance of catching up with or competing with the fresh faces and minds out of Stanford or other technically oriented schools.
		</p>

		<p>I have encountered situations in pair sessions where I feel that I am not processing the information as fast as some of the younger students. I think it’s possible that my performance is impacted or compounded by the stereotype threat of my age.
		</p>

		<p>To counter the stereotype threat, I need to develop mechanisms to negate the threat by reassuring myself that my age and experience can be an asset. While nimbleness is important to surviving in the tech world, reflection and pause can lead to smarter choices and ultimately better products.
