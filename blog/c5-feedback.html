		<h1>Peer Pairing and Giving Feedback</h1>
		<!-- <h2>subtitle</h2> -->
		<h3>January 4, 2015</h3>
		<p>Code pairing is an integral part of the DevBootcamp experience and it is widely used in software development. It involves two programmers working on the same coding solution in real time.
		</p>

		<p>There are varying models for code pairing. At DevBootcamp Phase 0, we use a peer pair model where there are two novice partners who take turns driving and navigating. A driver executes the code, while the navigator guides the session conceptually and outlines what needs to happen in the flow of the code.
		</p>

		<p>The benefits of pairing are clear: it facilitates learning and the transfer of knowledge, it encourages communication, it reduces coding errors and it develops the ability to think on your feet.
		</p>

		<p>Another essential tool at DevBootcamp is feedback. There are mechanisms to provide feedback to teachers, the program as a whole and other students - particularly pairing partners. Feedback is strongly encouraged as long as it is actionable, specific and kind.
		</p>

		<p>Actionable feedback is structured such that it addresses an issue that the student can feasibly improve on. Specific feedback identifies a focused area where there is room for improvement and kind feedback maintains a level of respect for the other person. Kind feedback does not mean being artificially nice or holding back if there is a problem, it means that you phrase things in a constructive, honest way that is genuinely intended to help the person improve.
		</p>

		<p>To be honest, I was anxious about the idea of peer pairing when I first enrolled at DBC. I am not a naturally outgoing person and pairing was outside of my comfort zone.
		</p>

		<p>After the initial awkwardness of getting used to pairing, I found that it was fun and productive and I could tell that I was developing new skill sets and growing as a person.
		</p>

		<p>The feedback I received from my peer pairing sessions has typically been very positive. In the coursework on HTML and CSS, I felt like I was able to effectively contribute to the pairing sessions and to help find good solutions to the challenges. I made a point of speaking up when I felt that I had information that would benefit the situation, and I made a point of communicating when I was unclear on anything.
		</p>

		<p>I received positive feedback from my pairing partners and I found it very validating and encouraging. I found that I was surprising myself with my talkativeness and it was really fun to be surprised like that.
		</p>

		<p>In the initial coursework on Ruby, I had two pairing sessions with one student in the same week and I found myself struggling. This student was very advanced in his Ruby knowledge and I was intimidated by the experience.
		</p>

		<p>In the first session, I got flustered and I had a difficult time overcoming my frustration and anxiety to focus on the problem. To my pairs' credit, he took the time to help me through the problem and was very patient.
		</p>

		<p>In the second session with the same student, I was able to fight back and manage my anxiety a little better. There were still concepts that I struggled with, but I feel that I was able to work through the solutions with my pairs' help.
		</p>

		<p>Those two pairing sessions, and the feedback I received from them, were initially very disheartening. I was running up against some <q>Fixed Mindset</q> issues as I read the feedback and tried to translate it into something I could work on. I had the idea about myself that I had a growth mindset, but when put to the test, there were still Fixed mindset tendencies in play.
		</p>

		<p>On the other hand, I was enthusiastic about challenging myself and I did not shy away from a second pairing with the advanced student. I am in this program to learn and grow and even though there were still some issues in the second session, I did far better in terms of sticking with the problem and working towards a solution.
		</p>

		<p>I have had positive guided and peer pairing sessions since then where I demonstrated a good working knowledge of Ruby collections and Ruby classes.
		</p>

		<p>Based on the feedback I've received in the program, my areas to improve are confidence in my ideas, vocalizing more in my thought process and expressing myself clearly and concisely. Based on feedback from those less positive pair sessions, I have room for growth in all areas.
		</p>

		<p>I enjoy writing feedback for other students. There are some really awesome people in this program and I want everyone to succeed. Also, the act of giving feedback to someone else forces you to crystalize your thoughts about the experience and ultimately consider and critique your own performance.
		</p>

		<p>Based on the rating of feedback I have submitted to other students, I have room to improve in the feedback I give. I would like all of the feedback I give to other students to be 100% specific, actionable and kind. I need to hone in on more specific, actionable items for my pair partners.
		</p>

		<p>Pairing and feedback are great tools to guide learning. I know after every pairing session the types of things I need to work on and the areas where I have improved.
