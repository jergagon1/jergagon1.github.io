		<h1>Who Knew I was Both Abstract and Sequential?</h1>
		<h2>Culture Blog: My thinking style</h2>
		<h3>December 7, 2014</h3>

		<p>Life during Phase 0 at Dev Bootcamp is awesome, but there is a lot of information to take in and process in a very short time.
		</p>

		<p>To help us absorb the information, we research both our Gregorc Thinking Style - based on the work of researcher Anthony Gregorc Ph. D - and if we have a growth or fixed mindset based on the work of Stanford Psychologist Carol Dweck. These evaluations help teachers address our needs and help us understand how we learn so that we can be more effective in our studies, projects and collaborations.
		</p>

		<p>There is a simple quiz you take to determine your Gregorc Thinking Style. The possible styles are Concrete Sequential, Abstract Sequential, Concrete Random and Abstract Random. These describe your perceptual quality which can be either concrete or abstract, and your ordering ability which can be sequential or random.
		</p>

		<p>People generally have tendencies from each of the thinking styles, and the quiz gives you a numerical range in each of the four styles.
		</p>

		<p>When I took the quiz, I scored highest in Abstract Sequential (48) with my second highest score in Concrete Random (36).
		</p>

		<p>According to Dr. Gregorc's Model of Abstract Sequential, I like when I am acknowledged and I like using analysis and logic when choosing how to act or solve a problem.
		</p>

		<p>I learn best when I have access to resources like teachers and reference material and when I'm in a stimulating environment but also when I'm able to work by myself.
		</p>

		<p>Also, the model says that I have trouble with:
		</p>

		<ul class="bulleted">
			<li>Working with people who have dissimilar views</li>
			<li>When I don't have enough time to get a comprehensive overview of a situation</li>
			<li>When I have to repeat tasks</li>
			<li>When I have to deal with red tape</li>
			<li>When I have to express myself emotionally</li>
			<li>Diplomacy</li>
			<li>Saving space for others in a conversation</li>
		</ul>

		<p>There are definitely parts of the model that apply to me very accurately, others less so. I feel that I'm pretty diplomatic and I tend to make space for other people in a conversation. I tend to be pretty sensitive to other people.
		</p>

		<p>In my experience at Dev Bootcamp up to this point, I have struggled with a few things including time management and being comfortable expressing my feelings. This is most likely based on the tendencies above, but both of these areas are key to success at Dev Bootcamp. My understanding of these issues and having a plan to deal with them is critical.
		</p>

		<p>My time management struggles stem from my need to have the overview of the things I'm learning rather than little pieces. Trying to get a meaningful Gestalt understanding of a computer language is a time <q>rabbit hole</q>. One concept leads to another and another and I can really burn through some time. When I have only a little piece of the puzzle and have to run with it, it's very uncomfortable for me.
		</p>

		<p>To try and address this time management issue, I need to practice being in the uncomfortable place caused by focusing on a smaller piece of the whole. My understanding is that in software development, people work on separate small pieces and then put them together to create a compiled set of code/files. So, practice now will help me later. I am trying to use timeboxing to limit my rabbit hole explorations.
		</p>

		<p>In terms of expressing my emotions and how that relates to my learning, I have been making a real concerted effort in this area. It's extremely uncomfortable for me to express my feelings and be outgoing. I have been trying to prioritize this with fellow students and DBC staff. Admitting that I don't understand something is also very challenging, not because of denial of lack of awareness of my ignorance, but because of shame/feeling stupid.
		</p>

		<p>I feel that I have made good progress in terms of self-expression when it comes to working with other people, but I still need to work on being able to admit my ignorance. I know that piece is crucial. Code pairing with more advanced students and staff will definitely help me in this area because it will force me to admit when I don't get something. I had some experience with that this week while pairing with a much more advanced student and while it was uncomfortable, I think it refocused me on the material.
		</p>

		<p>Also, code pairing will help expand my natural learning style because I do tend to like working by myself. I can already tell that code pairing is forcing me to grow and change and I need to keep it up.
		</p>

		<p>A growth mindset is essentially a mindset where you believe that intelligence can change and be developed. You embrace challenges and setbacks and you are not afraid to put effort into mastering something. You seek out feedback.
		</p>

		<p>A fixed mindset creates the need to be perceived as intelligent at all times. You avoid challenges and anything that can trip you up. You shy away from effort and you are upset by criticism.
		</p>

		<p>In terms of assessing if I have a fixed or growth mindset, I know that I do not shy away from hard work and effort. I'm working full time and doing Dev Bootcamp Phase 0, so I'm putting in up to 70 or 75 hours a week. I tend to be quick to admit my faults and mistakes. I like it when people give me honest feedback. These are growth mindset traits.
		</p>

		<p>On the other hand, I do like being perceived as intelligent and I can get frustrated or flustered when I make a <q>stupid</q> mistake. I think these traits fall more into the fixed mindset category.
		</p>

		<p>I think being humbled by working in teams with smart people and facing new challenging concepts will help keep my fixed mindset tendencies in check.
		</p>

		<p>That's it for now. On to Unit 2 Week 4!
		</p>
