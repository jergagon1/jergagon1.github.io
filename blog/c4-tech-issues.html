		<h1>Hacktivism</h1>
		<h2>Anarchy, Privacy and Digital Activism</h2>
		<h3>December 14, 2014</h3>
		<p>Hacktivism is a huge, complicated topic for a blog post, so I preface this by saying: don't expect a comprehensive solution or even a full overview of this issue in the next few paragraphs. I can only offer a few thoughts on it. However, with the leaking of the Sony emails, this topic is very current and it's a central issue in the tech world.
		</p>What exactly is the issue? Well, the central issue is electronic data. We all have tons of it and some of it contains very personal or sensitive information about ourselves, our health, our finances, our companies, etc...
		<p>Our personal information is a very tempting, juicy morsal of data for someone with the skills to retrieve it. Luckily for individuals, the data stored by big companies and politicians is an even juicier morsal.
		</p>Who are these individuals that have access to private data, corporate data and the ability to shut down a website with a few keystrokes? Obviously, the hackers.
		<p>As with all groups, the hacker community is a large diverse group of individuals with a wide range of interests, skill levels and values. Consequently, there is a wide spectrum of hacker activity ranging from "messing with" a public personality to taking a stand against civil injustice.
		</p>For that reason, people struggle with identifying the true nature of the hacker community. Is is a force for good, a group of criminals or a group of anarchists?
		<p>The media compounds the problem because the news that gets reported about hackers tends to be very negative. You hear a lot about credit card data breaches and nude photo leaks. You don't hear as much about the stories involving hacker whistle-blowing and exposing coverups.
		</p>For me, one of the more compelling cases for the positive impact of hacktivism is the series of highschool football player rape cases in Steubenville, Halifax and Maryville.  The local authorities were basically sweeping the cases under the rug to protect prominent citizens or football players. Anonymous facilitated the release of damning evidence that forced the hand of local prosecutors.
		<p>As I begin to dip my toe into the well of knowledge that a hacker draws from, I certainly find myself identifying with or at least empathizing with the hackers over corporate interests. However, I also believe that there is a huge burden on the hacker community to wield its power responsibly.
