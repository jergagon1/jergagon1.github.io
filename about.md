I am a full stack web developer with a passion for developing apps in Rails and JavaScript. I'm grounded, creative, highly adaptable and effective in working on complex projects with tight deadlines. I pay attention to detail and have an eye for troubleshooting and breaking problems down.

I have strong leadership, writing and communication skills and excel at leading teams and training employees.

My background is diverse and includes experience in music, architecture, CAD, and A/V production. I bring a wide array of skills and knowledge to any project.
